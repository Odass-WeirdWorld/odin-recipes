First TOP Fundation Project

This is my firs project in the Fundation Class from The Odin Project

The goal is to put all of the HTML knowledge I have been acquiring
so far into practice.

---> I'm going to build a basic recipe website!

            I'll use HTML only because it's the only language i've learned so far in the Fundation. 

Result will show that i'm familiar with git to manage the project, and I've understand the basics of HTML. 

First part : The Beggining. 

        Needed to get those git comands back, thank god there is the git Basics course. 
        But still not that "confy" with git, got to admit.

Second part : The Core Project. 

        Once the project started, i've been getting more at ease 
        with the git commands. 
        And once the index was done and the first recipe uploaded
        everything went smooth and easy to do.
        Going along with making news pages, commiting and pushing on git made it easier to do now. Feel way more confortable.

Project Completed.

        The project is now done, it took aroun 1h maybe h1:20.
        Very Cool to do it, really made me use all the things i've learned frow nom on the Fundation. It was realy fun and realy intuitive. It's realy making me wan't to go further in my learning! Awesome first project
