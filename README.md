First TOP Fundation Project

This is my firs project in the Fundation Class from The Odin Project

The goal is to put all of the HTML knowledge I have been acquiring
so far into practice.

---> I'm going to build a basic recipe website!

            I'll use HTML only because it's the only language i've learned so far in the Fundation. 

Result will show that i'm familiar with git to manage the project, and I've understand the basics of HTML. 

First part : The Beggining. 

        Needed to get those git comands back, thank god there is the git Basics course. 
        But still not that "confy" with git, got to admit.
