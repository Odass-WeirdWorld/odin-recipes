<h2>&ldquo;Bars with a shortbread-like base and topped with frosting and coconut.
&rdquo;</h2>

<p>This is a great cookie for Christmas. It makes alot like any bar cookie and the cherry glaze makes a beautiful presentation on the cookie tray. I like to put the glaze on while the bar arre just a little warm (cool about 25 minutes) that way the glaze really sinks in, don't worry it will setup as it continues to cool. Also finish off with a sprinkling of mini-choco chips.
