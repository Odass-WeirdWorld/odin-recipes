<h2>&ldquo;This hearty, vegetable lasagna is the only lasagna my husband will eat. We love it!!! 
    Hope you all enjoy as much as we do.&rdquo;</h2>

    <p>Finally! <strong>A veggie lasagna I like.</strong> 
        I added thawed and drained frozen spinach to the ricotta mixture
        (what is lasagna without spinach?), and I also followed other 
        suggestions and added about 3/4 cup each of finally chopped carrot, 
        broccoli, and zucchini. It was great. 
        This recipe has become my mainstay for veggie lasagna. </p>
